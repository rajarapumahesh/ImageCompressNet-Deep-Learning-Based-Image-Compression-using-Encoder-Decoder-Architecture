# ImageCompressNet-Deep-Learning-Based-Image-Compression-using-Encoder-Decoder-Architecture
he project "DeepLung: Automated Chest CT Scan Analysis for Pulmonary Diseases" utilizes an encoder-decoder architecture for image compression and reconstruction. The autoencoder model compresses chest CT scan images into a lower-dimensional representation and then reconstructs them back to their original form.
